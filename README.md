- The above wiring diagram shows the necessary connections for the functionality of the 12V solenoid device, being controlled by the Arduino Uno Micro-controller.
- In practice, the setup pictured will be used in conjunction with the 2-wire float switch(s), which will provide the input into the Arduino to control when the solenoid should open and close.
